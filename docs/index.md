# About

The ICANN RDAP Conformance Tool, often referred to as "RDAPCT", is program to help RDAP server operators find
issues of conformance to the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) specifications, as defined by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), and (optionally) the gTLD RDAP profiles, as defined by ICANN. RDAPCT may be
used by other RDAP server operators, such as ccTLDs and RIRs, but is primarily designed for gTLD RDAP service
operators. Apart from generic RDAP tests, there are no specific tests for IP addresses and AS Numbers RDAP servers.

RDAPCT operates by taking an RDAP URL, along with parameters defining the context of that URL, to send queries
to the RDAP server and then produces a results file.

ICANN also hosts an online version of RDAPCT at <https://webrdapct.icann.org>.
